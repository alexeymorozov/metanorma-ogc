WARNING: This gem is still under development.

== Functionality

This gem processes documents following a template for generating OGC documents. 
For http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] input, the Metanorma toolchain uses the Asciidoctor gem as its parser.

The gem currently inherits from the https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-standoc
gem, and aligns closely to it. Refer to the ISO gem documentation
for guidance, including https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-iso/wiki/Guidance-for-authoring

The following outputs are generated.

* an XML representation of the document, intended as a document model for OGC documents.
* The XML representation is processed in turn to generate the following outputs
as end deliverable OGC documents.
** HTML
** http://asciimath.org[AsciiMathML] is to be used for mathematical formatting.
The gem uses the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciimath[Ruby AsciiMath parser],
which is syntactically stricter than the common MathJax processor;
if you do not get expected results, try bracketing terms your in AsciiMathML
expressions.

== Usage

The preferred way to invoke this gem is via the `metanorma` script:

[source,console]
----
$ metanorma --type ogc a.adoc                   # output HTML 
$ metanorma --type ogc --extensions html a.adoc # output just HTML
$ metanorma --type ogc --extensions xml a.adoc  # output RSD XML
----

The gem translates the document into Metanorma XML format, and then
validates its output against the Metanorma XML document model; errors are
reported to console against the XML, and are intended for users to
check that they have provided all necessary components of the
document.

The gem then converts the XML into HTML.

The gem can also be invoked directly within asciidoctor, though this is deprecated:

[source,console]
----
$ asciidoctor -b ogc -r 'metanorma-ogc' a.adoc  
----

=== Installation

If you are using a Mac, the https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-macos-setup
repository has instructions on setting up your machine to run Metanorma
scripts such as this one. You need only run the following in a Terminal console:

[source,console]
----
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riboseinc/metanorma-macos-setup/master/metanorma-setup)
$ gem install metanorma-ogc
$ gem install metanorma-cli
----

== Approach

=== Document model

The OGC Document model used by this gem is an instance of the
https://github.com/riboseinc/isodoc-models[StandardDocument model].

The Metanorma XML format intends to introduce rigor into the OGC
standards authoring process, and is prescribed in a separate document.

=== Asciidoctor

Asciidoctor has been selected as the authoring tool to generate the document
model representation of OGC standards. It is a document formatting tool like
Markdown and DocBook, which combines the relative ease of use of the former
(using relatively lightweight markup), and the rigor and expressively of the
latter (it has a well-defined syntax, and was in fact initially developed as a
DocBook document authoring tool). Asciidoctor has built-in capability to output
Text, DocBook and HTML; so it can be used to preview the file as it is being
autA

Generating documents via a document model substantially automated formatting
associated with the document, including automating numbering of headings, figures,
tables etc, and automatically generating references and citations.
hored.

== Document Attributes

=== Common attributes

The gem relies on Asciidoctor document attributes to provide necessary
metadata about the document. The https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-standoc[metanorma-standoc]
gem documents the Asciidoctor document attributes common to all metanorma gems. 
Where these preexisting metanorma attributes correspond to attributes already used
by OGC in their Asciidoctor template, they are treated as synonyms of the Metanorma
attributes.  These include:

`:edition:`:: The document version; e.g. `2.0`.

`:revdate:`:: The date the document was last updated

`:copyright-year:`:: The year which will be claimed as when the copyright for
the document was issued

`:title:`:: The main component of the English title of the document
(mandatory). (The first line of the AsciiDoc document, which contains the title
introduced with `=`, is ignored)

`:doctype:`:: The document type (mandatory). The permitted types are:
+
--
* Standards
implementation-standard::: Implementation Standard (with or without Compliance Suite)
abstract-specification::: Abstract Specification (with or without Compliance Suite)
community-standard::: Community Standard (with or without Compliance Suite)
profile::: Profile (with or without Compliance Suite)
best-practices::: Best Practices Document
* Other
engineering-report::: Engineering Report
discussion-paper::: Discussion Paper
white-paper::: White Paper
user-guide::: User Guide
policy-directive::: Technical Committee Policy Directive
informative::: Informative
--

`:status:``:: The document status. The permitted types are: 

* SWG Work
* OAB Review
* OGC-NA Review
* Public Review
* Prepare for Approval
* TC Approval to Vote
* TC Vote
* PC Vote
* Published

`:committee:` (OGC: `:workingGroup:`):: The name of the relevant committee (mandatory)

`:language:` :: The language of the document (only `en` for now)  (mandatory)

`:published-date` (OGC: `:publicationDate:`):: The publication date for the document.
`:issued-date` (OGC: `:approvalDate:`):: The approval date for the document.
`:created-date`:: The creation date for the document.
`:submitted-date` (OGC: `:submissionDate:`):: The date at which the document was submitted to the standards body.

`:uri:`:: The URI to which this standard is published.
`:docnumber:` (OGC: `docReference`):: The internal identifier referring to this document.

The attribute `:draft:`, if present, includes review notes in the XML output;
these are otherwise suppressed.

== Asciidoctor features specific to OGC

The https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-standoc[metanorma-standoc]
gem documents the customisations of Asciidoctor markup common to all metanorma gems.
The following markup is specific to this gem:

`:external-id:`:: The external identifier referring to this document.
`:referenceURLID:`:: The identifier embedded into a document type-specific
external URL.

`:fullname{_i}`:: The full name of a person who is a contributor to the document.
A second person is indicated by using a numeric suffix: `:fullname`, `:fullname_2`, `fullname_3`, &c.

`:surname{_i}`:: The surname of a person who is a contributor to the document.
`:givenname{_i}`:: The given name(s) of a person who is a contributor to the document.
`:role{_i}`:: The role of a a person who is a contributor to the document. By default,
they are coded as an `editor`; they can also be represented as an `author`.

OGC `:editor:`:: corresponds to `:fullname:` with `role` = "editor"

== Examples

* link:spec/examples/rfc6350.adoc[] is an Metanorma Asciidoctor version of https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350[RFC 6350].
* link:spec/examples/rfc6350.html[] is an HTML file generated from the Asciidoctor.
* link:spec/examples/rfc6350.doc[] is a Word document generated from the Asciidoctor.
